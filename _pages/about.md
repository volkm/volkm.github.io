I am a researcher interested in the improvement of safety-critical systems through formal methods.

Since, 2021, I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Twente, working with Marielle Stoelinga.
Before, I was a PhD student at RWTH Aachen University, under the supervision of Joost-Pieter Katoen, working on <a href="https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/956330">Dynamic Fault Trees</a>.


# Research goal
My research goal is to improve the safety and reliability of complex, safety-critical systems through formal methods.
Certifying that systems, such as autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and robotic systems, operate safely and reliably is a major challenge today.
My aim is to
1. develop rigorous, automated techniques for modeling and analyzing safety-critical systems,
2. provide optimized implementations in mature tools for use by other researchers, and
3. apply the approaches in industrial collaborations.

In my research, I focus primarily on probabilistic model checking, and I am a main developer of the <a href="https://www.stormchecker.org/">Storm model checker</a>.
